Game Creation and Development
Welcome to Bento Creators! 

In this adorable mobile phone game, you'll combine different foods from a taditional Japanese conveyor belt - "kaiten-zushi" - to create the most delicious bentos imaginable. The game is set at the end of the rainbow, where you'll meet a cast of cute and friendly cloud creatures who will help you achieve bento-making excellence- the perfect â€œobento-tsukuri".

Your mission in the game is to assemble a bento for a customer who is located back on Earth, wishing for a delicious and balanced meal. Each customer has their own specific dietary preferences and requirements, so you'll need to pay attention to their orders and make sure you don't make any mistakes. If you make a mistake and create a bento that doesn't meet the customer's requirements, you'll get kicked off the wonderful land at the end of the rainbow and have to start again. However, if you create a bento that perfectly matches the customer's order, you'll earn lots of points and praise from the cloud creatures, as well as unlocking new yummy foods to your "kaiten-zushi". As you progress, bentos get more complex and requirements more elaborate, so look out!

So, what are you waiting for? Delve into this adorable rainbow universe and start crafting delicious bentos for people back on Earth with the head in the clouds!
